## Tokyo

We stayed in Tokyo for the first week, and explored some many cool places around the city, such as Meiji Shrine, Shibuya Crossing, and hiked a lot of mountains

## Hikes and Nature

If you told me a few years before this trip, that I would love hiking and enjoy nature, I would have vividly denied it.
In fact, I think it was the experiences of this trip, along with enjoying nature with friends, I guess is what continued
my love of photography and nature.
