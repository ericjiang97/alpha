I know I do this all the time, but once I’ve decided to upgrade my personal site.

The truth is that it actually gives me the opportunity to try different technologies as well as improving the overall performance and stack of the entire website.

The most recent upgrade involves moving to NextJS and Now – all of the pages are Server-Side Rendered (SSR) with the exception of blog pages, increasing the overall performance of the site.
