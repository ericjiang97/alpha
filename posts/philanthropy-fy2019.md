As part of my idea of giving back to society apart from volunteering and mentoring, I'm starting to kick off some donations and charity work. This past financial year (FY2019-2020), I've donated over A$220 to charities. This is broken down into $200 matched by my employer and $20 unmatched.

The bulk of the donations went to as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, with $100 going to foundations which support the movement in the US and a further $100 going to Indigenous Literacy Foundation here in Australia.

If you have any charities that you want to donate to, reach out I'll be happy to try and match your donations
