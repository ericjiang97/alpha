#### Course Information Header

We have a new course information header, which displays critical information about the progression of your plan as well as core course information. Otherwise view your course as normal.

#### Validation now in beta And Adding Units just Got Easier

We have introduced Validation in beta. Helping you to pick relevant units, at the right time and in the right order. Just remember you can still ignore validation warnings, they are just warnings after all. As well as units being to be added more easily, just click on a greyed out area and search as usual.

#### Server Side Features:

Most of this release focuses on our API, in order to migrate to Google App Engine, we recoded the App in `Java` allowing a more easier to use environment as well as models to help validation different DB schemas. Everything except for snapshots have been migrated over.
